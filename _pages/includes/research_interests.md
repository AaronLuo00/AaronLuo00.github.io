# 🔬 Research Interests

- **Flexible Diagnostic Models with Multi-task and Multi-modal Learning**: I work on developing advanced AI models that can simultaneously handle multiple diagnostic tasks while effectively integrating various types of medical data (imaging, clinical notes, lab results) to provide more comprehensive and accurate medical assessments.

- **Evaluating and Enhancing LLM Reasoning in Real-World Medical Settings**: I work on developing evaluation frameworks and benchmarks to assess and improve how large language models reason over complex, temporally extended medical data. My goal is to enhance their fidelity, calibration, and robustness, ultimately enabling trustworthy and generalizable clinical AI systems.
