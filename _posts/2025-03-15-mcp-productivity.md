# How Model Context Protocol (MCP) Is Changing AI-Powered Workflows

*March 15, 2025*

As someone who works at the intersection of AI and real-world applications, I've been watching the Model Context Protocol (MCP) ecosystem with genuine interest. MCP represents a shift in how AI systems interact with external tools — and the implications extend well beyond developer productivity.

## What MCP Actually Does

At its core, MCP standardizes how language models connect to external data sources and tools. Instead of building custom integrations for every API, MCP provides a universal protocol that any AI system can use to discover and invoke tools dynamically.

Think of it as USB for AI — a single interface that lets models plug into databases, file systems, web services, and specialized tools without bespoke engineering for each connection.

## Why This Matters for Research

For those of us working with clinical data pipelines, the appeal is obvious: AI systems that can seamlessly query medical databases, process imaging data, and cross-reference patient records — all through a standardized interface rather than fragile custom code.

The key insight is that **context is the bottleneck** for most AI applications. A model's reasoning is only as good as the information it has access to. MCP removes a major friction point in getting the right context to the right model at the right time.

## The Bigger Picture

MCP is part of a broader trend toward AI systems that don't just generate text, but *act* in the world — reading files, querying databases, executing code. This is exactly the capability stack needed for trustworthy clinical AI: models that can retrieve evidence, cross-check facts, and show their work.

I'm cautiously optimistic about where this leads. The protocol itself is open, the ecosystem is growing fast, and the potential applications in healthcare informatics are substantial.
